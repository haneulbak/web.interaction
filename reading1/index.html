            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Schwulst offers important viewpoints on website as a platform of creativity and individuality rather than of corporate values.
            <br>She points out that the web developers of today carry the burden of having to reinterpret what a website can be, in the era of mega corporate web platforms. 
            <br>She encourages young creatives to consider the endless possibilities in a website as not only a platform but also in itself an intricate artistic expression.
          
            <h4>Quotes</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><i>My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. 
            <br>In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously.</i></li>
            <br><br>
            <li><i>A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an archive of your complete works. 
            <br>That’s going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. 
            <br>It’s imperfect—maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that’s the beauty of it. 
            <br>Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?</i></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What values or practices help a web designer make creative choices in building websites?</li>
            <br><li>Is it possible at all for a creative individual's endeavour to create alternative platforms
            <br>in order to change the culture that's been formed by the monopoly of mega consumerist corporational online platforms?
        </li></ul>
