            It is interesting how websites in the 90s, with less tools than now, ironically seem to have made more diverse choices when it comes to the background color or pattern, format of the contents, and font or size of the texts. It seems that during the early, pre-corporate growth of website creation, the lack of consumerist trends allowed for greater freedom for various styles.
