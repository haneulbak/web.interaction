                One big dilemma of mine has been about my involvement in design technology and my growing identity as a creative coder. My decision to study creative technology was both out of intellectual, artistic curiosity and a capitalistic encouragement to equip myself for the ever-growing tech-dominant industry. I keep asking myself if I actually want to be a creative coder, when so many of the technologiests in the industy are using their knowledge to manipulate and profit from the general public with digital addiction, as well as to continue the abuse of the planet. If often feels like a complete retreat from the digital-dominant urban society is the only solution to free myself from this mess of a teched-up world. This writing points to the difficult realities about which I have been feeling strongly, and suggests some important standards that would help coders to choose the positive, worthy paths. Above all, this writing made me feel a little hopeful. I deeply appreciate that.

            It is interesting how websites in the 90s, with less tools than now, ironically seem to have made more diverse choices when it comes to the background color or pattern, format of the contents, and font or size of the texts. It seems that during the early, pre-corporate growth of website creation, the lack of consumerist trends allowed for greater freedom for various styles.
