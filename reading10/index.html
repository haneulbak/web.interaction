                It seems important to acknowledge the fundamental vanity "design" entails as a mode or an activity. In order to make decisions as ethical and positive as possible, designers must consider the context and consequence of their work.

                <i>
                "Design is added value. En masse, designers throw themselves into desires instead of needs. There is nothing wrong with admitting as much."<br><br>
                "The hope that some designers still cherish, of being commissioned to work from the perspective of objective need, is in vain. Design only generates longing. The problem is the problem of luxury."<br><br>
                "Today, an ‘important graphic design’ is one generated by the designer himself, a commentary in the margins of visual culture. Sometimes the design represents a generous client."<br><br>
