            <h4>Quotes</h4>
            <p class ="body-text">I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.

            <h4>Response</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
            I had no idea that a lot of websites coded by creative individuals emerged in the 90s, due to the misconception that technology simply evolves into greater compldexities and progresses into bigger audience as time passes by. But the websites of today tend to be more unoriginal and uniform due to the way most of the domains are owned by corporations. It seems very important to study the web pages coded during the short-lived post-academic, pre-corporational era of individuality.
