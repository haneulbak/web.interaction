            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>There are million ways to define and understand what code is. A coder's understanding of code is as valid as the next's.
            <br>But it is important to look into the relations between various elements of coding, such as computer, algorithm, software, or language.</p>
          
            <h4>Quotes</h4>
            <ul>
            <li><i>“Algorithm” is a word writers invoke to sound smart about technology.  
            <br>Journalists tend to talk about “Facebook’s algorithm” or a “Google algorithm,” which is usually inaccurate. 
            <br>They mean “software.”</i></li>
            <li><i>A programming language is a system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application. 
            <br>It’s an algorithm management system. This is why, despite the hype, it’s silly to say Facebook has an algorithm. 
            <br>An algorithm can be translated into a function, and that function can be called (run) when software is executed..</i></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How does one's understanding of computer and coding itself affect's one's capacity as a coder and programmer?</li>
            <br><li>Can coding be considered artistry?
        </li></ul>
