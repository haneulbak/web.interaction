            <h1>Donald Judd</h1>
            <p class="body-text">Donald Judd was an American artist 
            associated with minimalism. In his work, Judd sought
            autonomy and clarity for the constructed object and 
            the space created by it, ultimately achieving a rigorously 
            democratic presentation without compositional hierarcy.</p>
