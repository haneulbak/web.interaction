                I can never express myself perfectly. 
                There are only better and worse versions of expressions, 
                which I aim to create as accurate as possible. 
                It took me long to realize the imperfect nature of self-expression, 
                and even longer to accept it. 
                But it was not until I began to appreciate such fate of creative process 
                that I grew serious about creating art. 
                As much as I don’t know about others, the world, and the universe, 
                I don’t understand my <i>self</i>. 
                Why would I ever expect to perfectly express my self 
                when I don’t even understand it?
                <br><br>
                My work circulates around two major mysteries: the self and the universe. 
                I contemplate on my relationship to my self, environment, and the world, 
                & depict the reflections as films, videos, photographs, and installation. 
                <br><br>
                A self is a universe. 
                A universe consistently and persistently births and burns stars. 
                I see my creative expressions as the lights from the births and deaths of stars. 
                I aim to be an actively alive universe in this sea of universes.
