            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p class="body-text">
                The Internet is the new space for art, information, and curation. Its existence is redefining the ways in which art can be produced, exhibited, and curated. In the imminent future, websites themselves will be significant art pieces.

            <i>Websites are today’s most radical and important art objects. Because the Internet is not just another “media”, as the Old Media insists,but mostly a “space”
                <br><br>
                “Things” in the Internet exist in a specific location, while in magazines and on TV contents are mostly bullets of information. Online they constitute a body: they are parts of a new genre. They are Web Entities.
                <br><br>
                Most Web Entities are social entities. They get in touch and advertise their existence to each other. Similar to human beings, they will evaluate, criticize, “link” to each other, and ultimately, they develop a “taste”. Bob Dobbs (a friend of McLuhan) said: “advertising is communication between machines”. He also suggested that machines came alive in 1967 and that “now they are in an angelic state”. According to him, “advertising is communication between Angels”.
                <br><br>
                “Contemporary Art”, the Art of the Past Century, was based mostly on the following principle: “if you put something in an empty room, it seems strange and significant”. A variation of that was: “if you take something out of its context, it seems strange and significant”. Another was: “if you change the scale of something, it will seem strange and significant,” and a last one: “if you multiply something, it also becomes strange and significant”.
