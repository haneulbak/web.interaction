      <h2>Concept Statement</h2>
      <p>I am telling a personal story about my other self and friends 
        <br>in my fantastical home, which is made from memories and dreams. 
        <br>This virtual environment will transgress and challenge 
        <br>the conventional norms of a home by reimagining the physical space in terms of feelings, 
        <br>with an emphasis on personal importance and abnormal physicality.
      </p>
      <br>

            </ul>
      </ol>

    <h2>Project Mandate and Interaction Template</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to communicate a personal perspective on home by creating my emotional home. 
        <br>My other self and friends within the virtual space are granted transhuman abilities such as flying or complete honesty 
        <br>that would otherwise be unavailable in the “real” world in order to disrupt the tiring limitations of human physicality and the superficiality of educated societal facades. 
        <br>Additionally, the spatial aspects and the interactions contribute to the narrative in the way they invoke curiosity and confusion in order to have a memorable impact on the participant.
