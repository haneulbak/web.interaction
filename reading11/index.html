                This interesting manifesto made me realize how in fact the tools, creation, and values of graphic design and memes are very similar. Both graphic design pieces and memes utilize texts, images, and the relations between them in order to impact the audience with the message--both in words or imagery-- they aim to deliver. The writing also reminded me of how informative memes have been during the past few years of my young adult life, as I had started becoming more of a cynical, jaded millenial and begun consuming more meme contents. Memes seems to have a bigger cultural effect than its comical construction suggests, and offer a very interesting persepective about graphic design in relation to its cultural impact.

            <h4>Quotes</h4>
            <p class="body-text">
                <i>
                "Is it possible that graphic design has only one thing left to do, which is posting itself on the internet? And - to go a little bit further - is it possible taht jokes have an untapped political power, which was historically always present but never so useful and necessary as now? Could, then, the leftovers of graphic design be turned into jokes? Might - through this re-allegiance - design rediscover actual societal impact?"<br><br>
                "Design, gradually but certainly, has shifted from being a middle man in the social fabric between people and institutions, to functioning as a direct index of conditions of life and work in a given place. In other words, design is a direct agent of the socio-political realities lived by its makers."<br><br>
                "Imagine a joke. Imagine a joke that hits, again and again. A joke that self-replicates until it becomes the inescapable, omnipresent truth that hovers over each and every one of your political oppoments."<br><br>
