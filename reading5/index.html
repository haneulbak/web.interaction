            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p class="body-text">
                Artists would benefit greatly from divesting the uniform design structures of websites, because websites are not merely a tool for contemporary artists' career but an important platform for exhibition and curation. Recognizing the infinite possibilities of website design would allow for new space and place for contemporary art on the net.

            <i>This text is an attempt to document a thing always fleeting – the aesthetics of the web – without fixing it, since it begins with a concern about growing uniformity and ends with a call for change. 
                <br><br>
                To paraphrase Croatian artist Mladen Stilinović’s 1994 banner embroidered with the claim that ‘an artist who cannot speak English is no artist’, today one could say that a young artist who doesn’t have a website is no artist.
                <br><br>
                This is not reflected in artists’ websites: a small number of platforms such as Indexhibit and Cargo Collective are used by a large majority of artists when building their sites, responding to a checklist of unchanging components (CV, contact information, images). The consequence is that artists’ websites rarely do justice to their work.
                <br><br>
                the artist’s website as what it could be: an online exhibition platform.
                <br><br>
                Contemporary art is all over the internet.
                <br><br>
                The artist’s website is not net art. Nor is it a Tumblr.

            <h4>Questions</h4>

            <p class="body-text">
                In what ways can artists connect with independent web developers who can collaborate together on new web designs?
                <br>
                How can non-corporational developers survive in the overwhelmingly monopolyzing power of mega tech corporations and their uniform designs?
                <br>
                What are some good examples of creative websites for art exhibition?
